Ventilation through air leakage and mechanical means is the single largest source of heat loss in a home built to the minimum requirements of the OBC. However this approach supports compartmentalization as vertical shafts between floors and penetrations through interior separations are not needed for general apartment ventilation. A hybrid ventilation approach decreases the size of the mechanical equipment due to a smaller volume of outdoor air needed in each apartment.</p>
