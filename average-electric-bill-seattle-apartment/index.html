<p>Tenant pays electricity heat. The highest our bill has ever been is 55 per month July-August 2018 and the lowest it has ever been is 15 per month March-April 2017. I have built a cash flow spreadsheet to get a better sense of how much we need to make to live in Seattle with our other responsibilities. On the whole electrical usage runs about 8000 per month annually. Amli Mark 24 9 Reviews Seattle Wa Apartments For Rent Apartmentratings C.</p>
