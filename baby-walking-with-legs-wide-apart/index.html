Hip stiffness affects the babys ability to get up onto the knees The stiffness in the hip muscles affects the infants ability to get up into kneeling or onto all fours.

EMG neuromuscular studies of children with 6 months of walking experience have also shown that they will fire their outer hip muscles specifically the muscles that outwardly rotate their legs and that move their legs apart for stability. The tendency to keep the hips wide apart can also be seen when the infant lies on the tummy or stands on the knees.</p>
